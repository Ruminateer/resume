Developed various components for running \href{https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/en}{PaddlePaddle} workflows on Kubernetes.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Added Paddle predictor to \href{https://github.com/kserve/kserve}{KServe}, allowing users to serve Paddle models on Kubernetes.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Used KServe Python SDK and Paddle inference to develop Paddle Server, an HTTP server that serves Paddle models. Used GitHub workflows to manage its docker image.
        \item Added Paddle predictor to KServe inference service CRD and controller. Provided with only the location of Paddle models in the object spec, the controller can set up a directly usable autoscaled inference service using the Paddle Server image.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Developed \href{https://github.com/PaddleFlow/paddle-operator}{Paddle Operator}, allowing users to train Paddle models on Kubernetes.
    Upgraded the operator from Kubernetes 1.8 to 1.20. Migrated the project from Go Dep to Go Modules.
\end{itemize}
