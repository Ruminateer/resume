Developed various components for running \href{https://github.com/PaddlePaddle}{PaddlePaddle} workflows on Kubernetes.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Added Paddle predictor to \href{https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving}{KFServing}, allowing users to serve Paddle models on Kubernetes.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Used KFServing Python SDK and Paddle inference to develop Paddle Server, an HTTP server that serves Paddle models. Added GitHub workflows for building and publishing Paddle Server docker image.
        \item Added Paddle predictor support to KFServing inferenceservice CRD and controller. Provided with only the location of Paddle models in the object spec, the controller can set up a directly usable autoscaled inference service using the Paddle Server image.
        % \item Set up Argo based e2e tests for the whole process.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Developed \href{https://github.com/PaddleFlow/paddle-operator}{Paddle Operator}, allowing users to train Paddle models on Kubernetes.
    Upgraded the operator from Kubernetes 1.8 to 1.20. Migrated the project from Go Dep to Go Modules.
\end{itemize}
