\newcommand{\Insta}{
    \poswithprd{Course Project: Instagram Clone}{Sep 2019 -- Oct 2019}
    Developed a photo sharing website. Support posting, liking, commenting, and following.

    \begin{miniItemize}
        \item Used React for frontend. Implemented React components for posts, likes, and comments. Wrote pages for home feed, user profiles, following, followers, exploring, and account actions.
        \item Used Flask to serve the React app and REST APIs that handle Ajax calls. Stored data using SQLite. Deployed the website on AWS using Gunicorn and NginX.

\newcommand{\Pager}{
    \poswithprd{Course Project: Pager}{March 2019}
    Implemented a memory pager based on a vritual MMU with only read\_enable and write\_enable bits.

    \begin{miniItemize}
        \item Maintained the state of physical pages by triggering page faults. Emulated accessed bit and dirty bit. Used clock algorithm to decide the page to evict.
        \item Supported fork and copy-on-write. Minimized disk I/O and page copy to improve performance.
        \item Adopted an object-oriented approach. Designed classes for the memory, the swap space, physical pages, and processes. Encapsulated all states variables to increase maintainability.

\newcommand{\ThreadLib}{
    \poswithprd{Course Project: Thread Library}{Feb 2019}
    \begin{miniItemize}
        \item
        Led a group of 3 members. Implemented thread, mutex, and condition\_variable on multiprocessor systems using ucontext.h.
        \item
        Maintained queues of ucontext\_t to achieve FIFO scheduling. Swap context when the current thread is blocked, yield is called, or timer interrupt occurs.

\newcommand{\TSP}{
    \poswithprd{Course Project: Travelling salesman problem}{Dec 2018}
    \begin{miniItemize}
        \item
        Designed and implemented a heuristic algorithm and an exact algorithm for the travelling salesman problem using C++.
        \item
        Implemented Prim's MST algorithm.
        % Applied branch and bound for the exact algorithm:
        % Use the output of the heuristic algorithm as the initial upper bound.
        In the exact algorithm, used the algorithm to search for the MST that spans the unvisited points to estimate the cost of the current branch. Prune the current branch if the estimation exceeds the minimal cost so far.

\newcommand{\SillyQL}{
    \poswithprd{Course Project: SillyQL}{Nov 2018}
    \begin{miniItemize}
        \item
        Implemented a simple relational database using C++, which supports non-nested insert, delete, select, and join.
        \item
        Support multiple indices (hash based index or binary tree based) on each table. Defer updates on indices to improve performance.
    \end{miniItemize}

\newcommand{\LCTwoK}{
    \poswithprd{Course Project: LC2K ISA}{Sept 2018-Dec 2018}
    \begin{miniItemize}
        \item
        Implemented an assembler and a linker for LC2K ISA using C.
        \item
        Implemented a simulator for LC2K ISA using C.
        The simulator simulates a machine with a 5-stage detect\&forward pipeline and user-specified cache configuration.
