Developed observability and monitoring tools for AI model storage team.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed a logging context library in C++ and Python.
    Designed an abstract class to provide a general logging interface.
    Allowed users to create and modify subcontexts without affecting parent contexts.
    Developed a subclass to log AI model storage related events to \href{https://research.facebook.com/publications/scuba-diving-into-data-at-facebook/}{Scuba}.
    \item Migrated PyPer and Caffe2 checkpointing code from a singleton logger to the logging context.
    The logging context library is more robust, allows multithreading, and gives more C++ support.
    \item Developed a Cubism Dashboard to monitor checkpointing related statistics across all regions.
    \item Identified replicated tensors, allowing Hedwig peer-to-peer caching upon checkpoint loading.
\end{itemize}
