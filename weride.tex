Developed the tracking module for the perception team.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Merged obstacle tracking logics into a single operator.
    Refactored the grid tracking module, reducing its latency by over 10\%.
    \item Moved the grid tracking module out of the DAG critical path.
    Reduced critical path latency of the perception DAG by 23\%.
    Implemented prediction logic to accommodate the change.
    \item Implemented blind zone tracking algorithms. Mitigated blind zone related safety incidents.
\end{itemize}
