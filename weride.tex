    Refactored the grid tracking module. Identified and removed redundant data and computation. Simplified code and reduced grid tracking latency by over 10\%.
    \item Delayed the usage of grid tracking output to the next frame.
    Reduced critical path latency of the perception pipeline by 23\%.
    Updated the users of the output to accommodate the change.
    \item Implemented blind zone tracking algorithms. Mitigated blind zone related safety incidents.
\end{itemize}
