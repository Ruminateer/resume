\experience{Course Project: Pager}{2019-2-0}{2019-3-0}{
    Implemented a memory pager based on a virtual MMU with only read\_enable and write\_enable bits.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
              Maintained the state of physical pages by triggering page faults.
              Emulated accessed bit and dirty bit.
              Used clock algorithm to decide the page to evict.
        \item
              Supported fork and copy-on-write.
              Minimized disk I/O and page copy to improve performance.
        \item
              Adopted an object-oriented approach.
              Designed classes for the memory, the swap space, physical pages, and processes.
              Encapsulated all state variables to increase maintainability.
    \end{itemize}
